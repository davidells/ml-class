My solutions to the exercises from ml-class.org

Note: I've added this to my GitHub account only as a useful code based personal backup,
and as an avenue to demonstrate my ability to grasp the concepts covered. If you are
taking the class at ml-class.org or planning to take the class in the future, please
ignore this repo.
